The HTMEMO wait type in SQL Server is related to memory-optimized tables and memory-optimized indexes used with the In-Memory OLTP feature, introduced in SQL Server 2014. Specifically, it pertains to operations on memory-optimized tables in the Hekaton engine (which is the internal code name for SQL Server’s in-memory OLTP feature).

What Does HTMEMO Mean?
The HTMEMO wait type refers to waits related to memory-optimized tables during query execution. Specifically, it involves waiting on memory-optimized hash-based indexes, which are used for performing quick lookups and searches. These types of indexes are designed for in-memory processing, providing extremely fast access to rows in a table.

In memory-optimized tables, SQL Server uses hash indexes for fast lookups. The HTMEMO wait type occurs when a thread is waiting for memory resources or operations involving these hash-based memory-optimized indexes.

When Does HTMEMO Occur?
HTMEMO waits are typically seen when SQL Server needs to access or modify data in memory-optimized tables or indexes, and there are delays due to the following:

Hash Index Operations:

Memory-optimized tables typically use hash-based indexes for fast lookups. If there is contention or a lack of resources while performing hash-based operations (such as looking up data in these indexes), the session might experience an HTMEMO wait.
In-Memory OLTP Operations:

In-memory tables are optimized for high-speed transaction processing. When memory is constrained or when large amounts of data need to be processed using memory-optimized tables, this wait type can be observed.
Concurrency Issues:

If multiple queries are trying to access the same memory-optimized table simultaneously, contention can occur, leading to waits on hash-based indexes and ultimately HTMEMO waits.
Memory Pressure:

SQL Server might be under memory pressure, causing delays when accessing memory-optimized tables or indexes. If memory resources are exhausted or inefficiently allocated, it can result in waits for memory-related operations, which include HTMEMO waits.
What Causes HTMEMO Waits?
Memory Pressure:

SQL Server might be experiencing memory pressure, which can cause delays in accessing memory-optimized objects. This can be because of insufficient RAM for processing the in-memory OLTP workload or an overload in the buffer pool.
Hash Index Contention:

If there are concurrent queries that access memory-optimized tables with hash-based indexes, contention can occur, causing multiple queries to wait for access to the memory-resident data. This is particularly noticeable in workloads with high concurrency.
Inadequate Memory Allocation for In-Memory Tables:

If your system is not configured with enough memory for the In-Memory OLTP feature, you may see delays as SQL Server waits for the required resources to perform operations on memory-optimized tables and indexes.
Large In-Memory Table Operations:

Queries performing large-scale operations (such as bulk inserts or updates) on memory-optimized tables may encounter HTMEMO waits if the operations are resource-intensive or if there is contention for memory resources.
How to Diagnose and Investigate HTMEMO Waits:
To investigate HTMEMO waits, you can query SQL Server’s dynamic management views to identify which queries or operations are encountering this wait type.

Check Current Wait Statistics: You can start by checking the current wait statistics to see if HTMEMO is present and how much time is spent waiting on it:

sql
Copy
SELECT wait_type, wait_time_ms, waiting_tasks_count
FROM sys.dm_exec_wait_stats
WHERE wait_type = 'HTMEMO';
This will give you the total time spent on HTMEMO waits and how many tasks are waiting for the memory-optimized operations.

Monitor Active Sessions Waiting on HTMEMO: To identify the specific sessions that are currently waiting on HTMEMO, use the following query:

sql
Copy
SELECT r.session_id, r.wait_type, r.wait_time_ms, t.text AS sql_text
FROM sys.dm_exec_requests r
CROSS APPLY sys.dm_exec_sql_text(r.sql_handle) t
WHERE r.wait_type = 'HTMEMO';
This will show you which queries are currently waiting on HTMEMO and their SQL text.

Check Memory Usage: Since HTMEMO waits are often caused by memory pressure, you can monitor SQL Server's memory usage by querying the following:

sql
Copy
SELECT
    total_physical_memory_kb / 1024 AS total_physical_memory_mb,
    available_physical_memory_kb / 1024 AS available_physical_memory_mb,
    total_page_file_kb / 1024 AS total_page_file_mb,
    available_page_file_kb / 1024 AS available_page_file_mb
FROM sys.dm_os_sys_memory;
This will give you an idea of how much memory is available to SQL Server and whether memory pressure is contributing to the HTMEMO waits.

Examine In-Memory OLTP Configuration: If you suspect that memory-optimized tables and indexes are contributing to the issue, check your In-Memory OLTP configuration. Specifically, ensure that enough memory is allocated for memory-optimized tables. You can examine the current configuration with:

sql
Copy
SELECT
    name, size_in_bytes / 1024 / 1024 AS size_mb
FROM sys.dm_db_xtp_table_memory_stats;
This will show you the memory usage for memory-optimized tables.

How to Resolve HTMEMO Waits:
Increase Memory Resources:

If memory pressure is the cause, consider increasing the physical memory on your SQL Server. SQL Server needs sufficient memory to store memory-optimized tables and indexes. This is particularly important if you're using In-Memory OLTP for performance-sensitive applications.
Optimize In-Memory OLTP Workloads:

Try to optimize the queries and operations that access memory-optimized tables. Avoid large and complex queries that might overwhelm the system’s memory resources. Instead, break down large queries into smaller, more manageable parts.
Monitor and Reduce Concurrent Access:

If high concurrency is causing contention on memory-optimized tables, consider redesigning the workload to reduce contention. For instance, you could partition the data or adjust the concurrency patterns to allow for more efficient use of resources.
Optimize Hash Index Usage:

Ensure that memory-optimized tables use the most appropriate indexes. Inefficient or unnecessary hash indexes can contribute to HTMEMO waits, so reviewing and optimizing the indexing strategy for memory-optimized tables is essential.
Check and Adjust Resource Governor Settings:

If resource contention is occurring, you can use SQL Server's Resource Governor to control how resources are allocated to different workloads. This can help ensure that In-Memory OLTP operations get the memory they need to perform efficiently.
Rebuild Memory-Optimized Indexes:

If there is heavy fragmentation in your memory-optimized tables or indexes, consider rebuilding or reorganizing them. Fragmented memory-optimized indexes can contribute to inefficient operations and increased waits.
Use Appropriate Isolation Levels:

For high-concurrency workloads, consider using isolation levels such as Snapshot Isolation or Read Committed Snapshot Isolation (RCSI) to reduce locking and contention on memory-optimized tables.
Conclusion:
The HTMEMO wait type in SQL Server is associated with memory-optimized tables and hash indexes in the In-Memory OLTP feature. It occurs when SQL Server is waiting for memory resources or dealing with high concurrency on memory-optimized tables. Common causes include memory pressure, contention on hash indexes, and inefficient use of memory-optimized objects. To resolve HTMEMO waits, it's important to address memory-related issues, optimize in-memory table access patterns, and ensure proper resource allocation. By doing so, you can reduce waits and improve the performance of memory-optimized workloads.
